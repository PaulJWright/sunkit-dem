Differential Emission Measure
=============================

Finding the differential emission measure is a widely used technique throughout solar and stellar astrophysics returning the temperature
distribution of the underlying emitting plasma by combining the line intensity, or narrow-band filter measurements.
However, the direct recovery is an inverse problem: the observed intensity is the convolution of the emission lines, or filters sensitivity to temperature, and the physical properties of the underlying plasma.
The basic idea is that if one samples enough of the temperature range, it is in theory possible to recover information about the underlying plasma by inversion; however, due to the
nature of this problem any attempt to reconstruct the DEM leads to substantial noise amplification.
